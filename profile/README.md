Passionate software developer with over 7 years of experience in building robust and scalable applications. Proficient in a wide range of programming languages and technologies, including but not limited to Python, JavaScript, Java, and Ruby. Experienced in both frontend and backend development, with a deep understanding of frameworks such as React, Angular, Node.js, and Django.

Currently focused on developing modern web applications using a microservices architecture. Strong advocate for clean code principles, agile methodologies, and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices. Passionate about improving user experience and optimizing performance.

I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams and mentoring junior developers. My interests also extend to open-source contributions and exploring emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain.
